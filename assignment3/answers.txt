1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
With absolute positioning, you place an element excactly where you want it to be on the iste.
With fixed positioning, you place an element on an excact point relative to the browser window, meaning
it will be in a fixed position if you are scrolling.

2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
Using nth child pseudo selector. E.g. in the list from last excercise ul > ul > li:nth-child(3)
